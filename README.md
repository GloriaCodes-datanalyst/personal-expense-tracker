# Personal Expense Tracker ðŸ’°
This is a simple and practical command-line Python application that helps users track their income and expenses, analyze  spending habits, and manage personal finances more effectively.

## Description
This project was developed to solve a real-world need: managing daily persoanal finances.
It allows users to:
. Record their income and expenses
. View a running balance and;
. Analyze spending by category or by month.

The project is built in Python and uses JSON for data storage.
This demonstrates core programming concepts including functions, file handling, error handling, data structures(lists, dictionaries), and user interaction.

## Features
- Add income/expense transactions
- View all transactions with details 
- Remove transactions by description
- View total balance
- View and analyze spending by category
- Monthly spending summary
- Auto-save data in JSON

## Inspiration
Built as part of my journey learning Python and applying it to real-world problems like budgeting and money tracking.

## ðŸ¤– AI Assistance
I used AI to:
- Debug and correct my code
- Understand errors and fix error messages in my code
- Learn how the structure should look and why certain things go wrong
